## 2. Project Overview
---
Fae's Meal Suggestion App is a mobile application created for the purposes of fulfilling the requirements of Assignment 1 in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was made within Android Studio, using Kotlin code. The app's purpose is for users to input the time of day and receive advice on what to consider eating based on the time of day stated.

As stated previously, this application was developed to fulfil the requirements of Assignment 1, and thus, is not only a fully functional application in its own right, but also utilizes GitHub for version control and automated testing using GitHub Actions.

## 3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

### Purpose and Features

Purpose:
Once again, the main goal of this app is to aid users that are unsure of what meals to prepare or eat for any given time of day and offer them suggestions.

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: A colorful user interface which includes Fae, a lovely assistant that instructs the user on exactly how to navigate the app and input the correct prompts in order to get the desired results.
- Feature 2: Handles user errors such as not inputting a prompt or inputing the incorrect prompt, and aids the user in correcting their mistakes.

These features serve to create a very user friendly experience that most users should be comfortable navigating and making use of.

## 4. Design Considerations
---

```markdown

# The design of the Fae's Meal Suggestion App took the following points in account:

1. User Friendliness: The app was designed to make things as easy and intuitive as possible for any type of user to navigate through effortlessly.
   
2. Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features to improve functionality and to give users an easy time.
```

## 5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

---
```markdown
# GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

# GitHub Actions:
I utilized an automated workflow using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## 7. Challenges and Learnings
---

```markdown
# Learning from mistakes and overcome hurdles

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenging tasks, including:

1. Challenge 1: Working with ImageViews despite not having learnt about them in detail yet.
   - Solution: A lot of trial and error as well as some critical thinking and further independent research.
   
2. Challenge 2: Working with a "when" statement that used multiple inputs to produce the same output in order to account for users not capitalizing their prompts.
   - Solution: Some critical thinking and using knowlegde acquired from previous applications that I've developed.

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging which will serve to shorten development time for future applications.

## 8. Future Enhancements

---

```markdown
## Potential updates to my application

Even though the application achieves the desired goal, some additions may be implemented to improve usefulness and aesthetic.

1. Feature 1: Adding functionality to a second screen to provide room for even more suggestions and images for any given time of day.
2. Feature 2: Accounting for more specific times of the day to give users more suggestions than currently available.
3. Feature 3: Adding sound effects to improve the user experience.

These updates would greatly improve the app’s usability and make it an overall better experience for users.
