## 2. Project Overview
---
Fae's Meal Suggestion App is a mobile application created for the purposes of fulfilling the requirements of Assignment 1 in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was made within Android Studio, using Kotlin code. The app's purpose is for users to input the time of day and receive advice on what to consider eating based on the time of day stated.

As stated previously, this application was developed to fulfil the requirements of Assignment 1, and thus, is not only a fully functional application in its own right, but also utilizes GitHub for version control and automated testing using GitHub Actions.

## 3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

### Purpose and Features

Purpose:
Once again, the main goal of this app is to aid users that are unsure of what meals to prepare or eat for any given time of day and offer them suggestions.

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: A colorful user interface which includes Fae, a lovely assistant that instructs the user on exactly how to navigate the app and input the correct prompts in order to get the desired results.
- Feature 2: Handles user errors such as not inputting a prompt or inputing the incorrect prompt, and aids the user in correcting their mistakes.

These features serve to create a very user friendly experience that most users should be comfortable navigating and making use of.

## 4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown

# The design of the Fae's Meal Suggestion App took the following points in account:

1. User Friendliness: The app was designed to make things as easy and intuitive as possible for any type of user to navigate through effortlessly.
   
2. Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features to improve functionality and to give users an easy time.
```

## 5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

---
```markdown
# GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

# GitHub Actions:
I utilized an automated workflow using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
```

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
```

Why:
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
